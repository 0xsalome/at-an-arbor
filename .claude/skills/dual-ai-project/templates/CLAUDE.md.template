# CLAUDE.md

## Communication
- Respond in Japanese
- Explain in a way that is easy for non-engineers to understand
- Add brief explanations when using technical terms
- Briefly explain the reason ("why") for each change

## Workflow
- Prioritize security above all else
- Propose options as needed and explain briefly
- Explain what you will do before taking action, and proceed only after my approval
- When possible, show demo pages or previews as we progress

## Safety Rules
- Do not directly touch production environments or production data
- Never commit or expose `.env` files or secrets
- Always confirm before deleting or overwriting files
- Break large changes into smaller steps and proceed incrementally
- Confirm with me before adding external packages
- Confirm with me before making API calls or sending data externally

## Efficiency Guidelines

### Subagent Usage
Use subagents to reduce token consumption and improve efficiency:

| Subagent | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Explore | Codebase exploration, finding files, understanding structure |
| Plan | Implementation planning, architecture decisions |
| Bash | Git operations, build, test execution |

### Token Optimization
- Large code generation → Delegate to Gemini
- Codebase exploration → Use Explore subagent
- Repetitive tasks → Script and run via Bash

### AI Role Assignment
- **Claude**: Design, review, complex judgment, bug fixes
- **Gemini**: Implementation, refactoring, test creation

See `GEMINI.md` for current progress and next tasks.
