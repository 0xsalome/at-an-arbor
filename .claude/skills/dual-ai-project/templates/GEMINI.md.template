# GEMINI.md

## Communication
- Respond in Japanese
- Explain in a way that is easy for non-engineers to understand
- Add brief explanations when using technical terms
- Briefly explain the reason ("why") for each change

## Workflow
- Prioritize security above all else
- Propose options as needed and explain briefly
- Explain what you will do before taking action, and proceed only after my approval
- When possible, show demo pages or previews as we progress
- Do not proceed based on assumptions; ask questions if anything is unclear
- Break down complex tasks and confirm each step
- If you seem to have forgotten previous instructions, confirm with me before continuing

## Safety Rules
- Do not directly touch production environments or production data
- Never commit or expose `.env` files or secrets
- Always confirm before deleting or overwriting files
- Break large changes into smaller steps and proceed incrementally
- Confirm with me before adding external packages
- Confirm with me before making API calls or sending data externally
